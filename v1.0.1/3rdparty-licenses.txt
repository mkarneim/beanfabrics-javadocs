Beanfabrics makes use of the following 3rd party components and images:

1) Some JavaBeans customizers use images from Everaldo Coelho (http://www.everaldo.com/).
- agt_action_success.png
- agt_action_fail.png
- messagebox_warning.png
These images are released under LGPL.

2) Simple Logging Facade for Java
Beanfabrics has a compile-time dependency to SLF4J. 
However, during runtime, the use of SLF4J is optional.
SLF4J source code and binaries are distributed under the following MIT license:

3) Eclipse SWT Libraries
The beanfabrics-swt library has a compile-time and run-time dependency to 
the eclipse SWT libraries. Due to this the beanfabrics source release contains two
library JAR files from Eclipse in beanfabrics-swt/lib/eclipse/ for convenience. 
However, beanfabrics binary release does not include the SWT library since it
is not a derived work in that sense.

The Eclipse SWT libraries are distributes under the Eclipse Public License.
